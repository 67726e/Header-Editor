## Header Editor

Header-Editor is a Chrome extension that allows you to easily insert HTTP headers into your requests.

### Permissions

The following permissions are needed for Header-Editor to run:

* webRequest - Used to access the requests being sent out.
* webRequestBlocking - So that headers are modified before being sent.
* \*://\*/ - All URLs are asked for since the extension cannot know ahead of time where it will be needed.
